   Apparently the cheaper CO2 sensors have their value falsified by a lot of factors. Those around 100 EUR are more sensible.

   Probably requires some kind of RJ45 sniffing or documentation of HS11A-1's protocol.

   This apparently can only change the height, it can't detect the current height:
   https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/giannozzo/office-desk-web-control-6d64c1
   It's also not certain whether the protocol is the same.
